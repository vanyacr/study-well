## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench installed and running
*   Git installed on your machine

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
```

### 3. Database Setup (Crucial Step)

You must execute the provided SQL scripts in the correct order to set up the database.

1.  Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your local MySQL instance.
2.  Execute the `master_setup.sql` file to create the `studywelldb` schema, tables, and all backend logic (triggers, procedures, functions).
3.  **Verify Connection:** Open `db_connection.py` and ensure the `db_config` dictionary matches your local MySQL credentials.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit application from your terminal.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open automatically in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 6. Login Credentials for Demo

You can use the following pre-populated accounts to explore the application:

| Role | Name | Email | Password | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Student | Vanya Sharma | `vanya@test.com` | `studentpass`| Main user, rich data. |
| Student | Priya Patel | `priya@test.com` | `demopass` | User for high-stress trigger demo. |
| Student | Aarav Sharma | `aarav.sharma@test.com`| `demopass` | Another populated user. |
| Admin | Admin User | `admin@test.com` | `adminpass` | Main admin account. |

## ✅ Demonstrating Key DBMS Concepts

This project was specifically designed to meet the requirements of the DBMS course by implementing and showcasing the following concepts:

| Concept | How to Demonstrate in the App |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Functions** | 1. **`fn_GetAverageStress`**: View the "Weekly Stress Average" metric on the Dashboard. <br> 2. **`fn_IsTaskUnlocked`**: Go to the Tasks page and observe the 🔒 and ⏳ icons, which are controlled by this function. |
| **Stored Procedures** | 1. **`sp_RegisterUserWithSemester`**: Register a new user from the "Create an Account" tab. <br> 2. **`sp_CompleteTask`**: On the Tasks page, click the "Mark Complete" button for any task. |
| **Triggers** | 1. **`trg_UnlockDependentTask`**: Mark Vanya's task 'Submit Project Proposal' as complete, then check the Notifications page for the automated "Task Unlocked" message. <br> 2. **`trg_CheckConsecutiveHighStress`**: Log in as Priya Patel, go to the Wellness page, and log a stress level of 8 or higher. An instant alert will appear, and a notification will be generated. |
| **Complex Queries** | 1. **JOIN Query**: The entire Task List on the Tasks page is generated by joining the `Tasks` and `Courses` tables. <br> 2. **AGGREGATE Query**: The "Hours by Course" bar chart on the Dashboard is created using a `SUM()` and `GROUP BY` query. <br> 3. **NESTED Query**: The `trg_CheckConsecutiveHighStress` uses a subquery to count the recent high-stress logs. |
